# Terminator Development VM

This directory contains the Vagrant configuration for setting up a Windows 10 development environment for the Terminator project.

## Prerequisites

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Configuration

The VM is configured with:
- Windows 10 as the base OS
- 4GB RAM
- 2 CPU cores
- SSH access (port 2222)
- The entire workspace is synced to `C:/Users/vagrant/terminator` in the VM
- username - vagrant
- password - vagrant

## Usage

1. Start the VM:
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

2. Connect to the VM:
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh
   ```

3. The workspace will be available at `C:/Users/vagrant/terminator` inside the VM

4. To stop the VM:
   ```bash
   vagrant halt
   ```

5. To destroy the VM and start fresh:
   ```bash
   vagrant destroy
   ```

## Remote Desktop (RDP) Connection

You can connect to the VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) in two ways:

### Quick Connection
Simply run:
```bash
vagrant rdp
```
This will automatically launch your default RDP client with the correct connection details.

### Manual Connection
If you need the current RDP connection details (which may change between VM restarts), run:
```bash
vagrant winrm-config
```

You can then use any RDP client (like Windows Remote Desktop Connection or Remmina) to connect using the details from the command output.

## VS Code / Cursor Remote SSH

To use VS Code or Cursor with Remote SSH:

1. First, add this entry to your SSH config file:

   For Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   $sshConfig = @"
   Host default
     HostName 127.0.0.1
     User vagrant
     Port 2222
     UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
     StrictHostKeyChecking no
     LogLevel FATAL
   "@
   Add-Content -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config" -Value $sshConfig
   ```

   For macOS/Linux (Bash):
   ```bash
   cat << 'EOF' >> ~/.ssh/config
   Host default
     HostName 127.0.0.1
     User vagrant
     Port 2222
     UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
     StrictHostKeyChecking no
     LogLevel FATAL
   EOF
   ```

   You can change the `Host` name from `default` to anything you prefer.

2. Then connect using:
   ```bash
   code --remote ssh-remote+default C:/Users/vagrant/terminator
   ```
   Replace `default` with your chosen hostname if you changed it.

   When prompted for a password, use: `vagrant`

## Development Workflow

1. The entire workspace is synced between your host machine and the VM
2. Changes made on either side will be reflected on the other
3. You can use your preferred IDE on the host machine while running the code in the VM

## GUI Application Launching

When working through SSH or non-interactive sessions, you can use the `gui-shell` tool to launch an interactive PowerShell shell in the active GUI user session (session 1). This allows you to interact with the Windows desktop environment as if you were logged in via RDP, even from SSH or VS Code Remote SSH. The shell you get is running in the correct session for GUI apps, so any GUI applications you launch from within it will appear on the Windows desktop.

### Usage

To start an interactive PowerShell shell in the GUI session:
```powershell
gui-shell
```

Once inside the shell, you can launch GUI applications or run any commands interactively as if you were at the Windows desktop.

### Features
- Launches a PowerShell shell in the GUI user session (session 1)
- Any GUI apps started from this shell will appear on the Windows desktop
- No need for RDP: interact with the desktop session from SSH or remote environments

### Requirements
- PSTools must be installed (automatically handled by the Vagrant setup)
- Requires an active user session on the Windows VM

## Notes

- The VM uses WinRM for initial setup and SSH for subsequent connections
- Default credentials are:
  - Username: vagrant
  - Password: vagrant
- SSH is configured to start automatically on boot

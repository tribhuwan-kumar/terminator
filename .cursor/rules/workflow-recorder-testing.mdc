# Workflow Recorder Testing and Quality Standards

## Objective

To ensure the `terminator-workflow-recorder` captures UI interactions with high fidelity. The primary goal is to achieve 1:1 accuracy between user actions and recorded `WorkflowEvent`s, both in event count and data content. This is critical for creating reliable automation from recordings.

## Core Principles

- **Precision Over Speed**: Tests must validate the _exact_ number and type of events are fired for specific UI interactions.
- **Data Integrity is Critical**: Event payloads (e.g., URLs, text values, element roles) must be rigorously verified against the actual UI state at the time of interaction.
- **Test Complex, Realistic Scenarios**: Simple unit tests are insufficient. Workflows should mimic real user behavior, such as navigating between tabs, handling iframes, and interacting with dynamic elements like autocomplete.

## Key Testing Scenarios & Assertions

These are minimum quality gates for the recorder. If these scenarios fail, the recorder's implementation in [`terminator-workflow-recorder/src/recorder/windows/mod.rs`](mdc:terminator-workflow-recorder/src/recorder/windows/mod.rs) must be fixed.

### 1. Form & IFrame Interaction

- **Reference**: [`browser_integration_test.rs`](mdc:terminator-workflow-recorder/tests/browser_integration_test.rs)
- **Scenario**: Fill out a form where fields are located inside an `<iframe>`.
- **Assertions**:
  - The test must first locate the `iframe` and use it as a scope for subsequent element lookups.
  - For each field filled, assert that _exactly one_ `TextInputCompleted` event is fired upon completion (e.g., tabbing out).
  - Verify the `text_value` and `field_name` in the event match the UI.

### 2. Autocomplete / Suggestion Selection

- **Reference**: [`text_input_integration_test.rs`](mdc:terminator-workflow-recorder/tests/text_input_integration_test.rs)
- **Scenario**: Type into a field to trigger a dropdown, then select a suggestion using the keyboard (arrow keys + Enter).
- **Assertions**:
  - Assert that _exactly one_ `TextInputCompleted` event is fired.
  - The event's `input_method` **must** be `TextInputMethod::Suggestion`.
  - Assert that **no** spurious `ButtonClickEvent` is generated from the suggestion selection. This is a critical noise-reduction metric.

### 3. Browser Navigation

- **Reference**: [`browser_integration_test.rs`](mdc:terminator-workflow-recorder/tests/browser_integration_test.rs)
- **Scenario**: Switch between browser tabs or navigate to a new URL.
- **Assertions**:
  - Assert a `BrowserTabNavigationEvent` is captured.
  - Verify the `to_url` property is correct.
  - Verify the `to_title` property. Use a `.contains()` check for robustness, as titles often include the browser name (e.g., "Example Domain - Google Chrome").

## Test Implementation Pattern

- **`expect_event` Helper**: Use a helper function that polls the event stream with a timeout and a **specific predicate**. The predicate should check event _content_, not just type, to avoid capturing the wrong event.
- **`assert_no_event` Helper**: Use a helper to verify that unwanted, noisy events are _not_ generated within a short time frame after an action.

## Quality Metrics to Optimize

- **Maximize**:
  - **Data Accuracy**: Correctness of event data (URLs, text values, `input_method`).
  - **Event Correctness**: 1:1 mapping of user action to the correct event type and count.
- **Minimize**:
  - **Event Noise**: Spurious or redundant events for a single user action.
  - **Test Flakiness**: Use specific predicates and iframe handling to create deterministic tests.
  - **Event Latency**: Time between user action and event capture.

# testing recorder

sometimes i just want to test some elements capture with recorder, in this case i run this command in background terminal:

$process = Start-Process -FilePath "cargo" -ArgumentList @("run", "--example", "debug_mcp_recording") -NoNewWindow -PassThru -RedirectStandardOutput "recording_5sec.txt" -RedirectStandardError "recording_5sec_error.txt"; Start-Sleep 5; if (!$process.HasExited) { $process.Kill(); Write-Host "Recording stopped after 5 seconds" } else { Write-Host "Process completed naturally" }; Write-Host "Exit code: $($process.ExitCode)"


click an element, hardcoded for now:
'''
cargo test test_i94_website_search_click --release -- --nocapture
